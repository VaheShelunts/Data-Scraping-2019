It quite makes sense as her songs are more sad/melancholic with the theme being reflections about her broken relationship with ex-boyfriend. The most negative song is \"Hello\". In contrast, Queen's and Florence's songs are more positive with the Quueen's \"Don't Stop me Now\" being the most positive one."
